# Usage  
This application generates a robot opponent to play rock paper scissors with. We used the Rapid API Rock, Paper, Scissors to create the game play. The user is presented with the options to play 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'. The game plays to best of three. We also used the Robohas API that randomly generates a robot image and name to play as the oponent. These opponents with their win record is stored in local storage to be played again it the user wants. We used Bulma styling elemnts to make the page more responsive on all devices.
